    <h2>Something about Myself</h2>
    <p>I am a student who is studying in Bravo Secondary School.</p> 
    <p>I believe that studying in school <i>may not</i> be such a good idea as I have to spend a lot of time attending lessons and doing homework, instead of pursuing my interests.</p>
    
    <h2>Subjects I (Have to) Take</h2>
    The subjects that I am taking now, with my favourite subject at the top, are:
    <ol>
      <li> Mathematics
      <li> Science
      <li> English
      <li> History
    </ol>
    
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>I am learning coding on my own, something which I believe is practical. I love to play football and pool, so I joined the football CCA in my school.</p> 
    <p>From time to time, I sign up for coding competitions. I also enjoy designing apps for people to use in their daily lives.</p>
